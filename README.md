# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Steve wanted to look into stocks for oil companies because his parents were considering investing. We prepared Steve a script that could help him analyize thousands
of lines of code efficiently. The script creates a spreadsheet to show help how successful stocks were in a certain year.
## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
They both run very fast! Much faster than the original.

2017 was a much better year to invest in oil. ENPH seems to be the safest bet because it did well in both charts.

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Refactoring code is a great way to make a program or script faster. Speed can be very important when dealing with large data or frequent use of the same script. The disadvangtage to refactoring code is that it in itself takes time as well as the possiblity of not making any improvments. Some code is easier to refactor than others as some code is not written well and hard to read. And some code is hard to make changes to because of not being written well. Whether you're going to refactor or not, its best just to write good code.
## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Refactoring the script to use lists made it faster.
