# stock-analysis
## Overview:
Steve wanted to look into stocks for oil companies because his parents were considering investing. The script he is using is too slow and he isn't getting the results he wants. We prepared Steve a script that could help him analyize thousands of lines of code efficiently. 
## Results:
They both run very fast! Much faster than the original.

2017 was a much better year to invest in oil. ENPH seems to be the safest bet because it did well in both charts.

## Conclusion
Refactoring code is a great way to make a program or script faster. Speed can be very important when dealing with large data or frequent use of the same script. The disadvangtage to refactoring code is that it in itself takes time as well as the possiblity of not making any improvments. Some code is easier to refactor than others as some code is not written well and hard to read. And some code is hard to make changes to because of not being written well. Whether you're going to refactor or not, its best just to write good code.
