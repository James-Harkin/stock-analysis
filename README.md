# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Steve wanted to look into stocks for oil companies because his parents were considering investing. We prepared Steve a script that could help him analyize thousands
of lines of code efficiently. The script creates a spreadsheet to show help how successful stocks were in a certain year.
## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
